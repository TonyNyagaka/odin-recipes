    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Iâ€™m sure everyone has their own favorite go-to lasagna recipe, but I'd just like to offer that this really is The Best Lasagna Ever. Growing up, my mom and her friends used to make it for potlucks and gatherings, and part of its appeal is that the ingredients used are totally basic; you don't have to hunt down fresh basil or mozzarella cheese or handmade sausage from an Italian mama in old Napoli. Anyone can make this, anywhere, anytime. Out of all the Italian dinner ideas in the world, this is one of the easiest.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Italian sausage & ground beef </li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese </li>

            <li>Lasagna noodles </li>
            <li>Onion & garlic </li>
        </ul>
